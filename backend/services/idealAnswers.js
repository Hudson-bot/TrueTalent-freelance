            'What is closure?': 'A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned. It helps in data privacy and maintaining state.',
            'Explain promises': 'Promises are objects representing eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous operation. They have states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and methods like .then() and .catch() for handling results.',
            'What is event bubbling?': 'Event bubbling is the process where an event triggers on the deepest target element, then bubbles up through its ancestor elements in the DOM hierarchy.',

            'How to handle async operations?': 'Async operations can be handled using: 1) Promises with .then()/.catch(), 2) async/await syntax, or 3) callbacks. Async/await is the modern preferred approach for cleaner, more readable code.',
            'Explain error handling': 'Error handling in JavaScript uses try/catch blocks. For async code, use .catch() with promises or try/catch with async/await. Always handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors.',
